Because the tribe had no authorization to use the Dodge Flat groundwater, its use did not have priority over the company's rights. The change use application did not threaten to prove detrimental to the public interest. The company was only permitted to pump water up to the amount of the unappropriated perennial yield. The State Engineer imposed this limitation in part to protect the Truckee River water quality and native fish habitats.

Neither § 533.040 nor the anti-speculation doctrine limited the free alienability of water rights as separate property.

The argument that vested water rights could be lost by applying for and receiving a permit modifying the use of those rights failed as nothing in Nev. Rev.

Thus, the cancellation and later reinstatement of the city's permit did not affect its underlying vested rights.

The statute was not ambiguous. To say that the United States, as owner of the public land, had to issue itself a permit to lease or graze livestock upon the land was an illogical and unreasonable construction of the statutory language. The statute indicated it required an applicant to have some legal authority to use the public land for grazing purposes and nothing else. The BLM was a qualified applicant under Nev. Rev.

State, 117 Nev. 235",Supreme Court of Nevada,2001-04-11,"Petitioners, a county and a private not for profit organization, sought a writ of prohibition to prevent respondents, the state, the department of natural resources, an irrigation district, and others, from granting additional rights to withdraw surface water or groundwater from a river system. Petitioners also sought a writ of mandamus challenging respondents' public trust obligations in managing and appropriating the river's water flows into a lake at the end of the river system. The supreme court denied the petitions, holding that the federal court, which had continuing involvement in the monitoring of the river system for more than 80 years, was the proper forum for the redress that petitioners sought. The decree previously issued by the federal court involved the allocation of interstate waters between California and Nevada, and a consistent and controlling interpretation by a federal court of competent jurisdiction was more appropriate. In addition, the supreme court lacked jurisdiction over several interested parties, including an Indian tribe and the United States.",lake;river;decree;river basin;water rights;appropriation;parties;flows;district court;reservation;reservoir;waters;public trust;valley;mandamus;rights;basin;exclusive jurisdiction;natural resources;navigable;public trust doctrine;surface water;proceedings;intervene;fishing;NRS 34.160;NRS 34.320;petition denied,"Mineral County, NV",38.688254,-118.693706,117 Nev. 235,,Opinion,application/pdf,,,

Court, 116 Nev. 805",Supreme Court of Nevada,2000-08-24,"Real parties in interest, water commissioners and state engineer, sought an order from respondent district court directing petitioners, Indian tribe, to show cause why they should not have been held in contempt for frustrating the enforcement of water rights. Petitioners claimed the district court was without jurisdiction based on their sovereign immunity. Purchase of the reservation land subject to previously adjudicated water rights constituted an express waiver of sovereign immunity, and petitioners' actions in benefiting from and abiding by the Humboldt Decree for more than five decades served to ratify this waiver. District court was therefore within its authority in exercising jurisdiction over petitioners concerning the alleged interference with the administration of water rights pursuant to the decree.
